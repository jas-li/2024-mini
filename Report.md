# Exercise 1
1. What are the "max_bright" and "min_bright" values you found?
max_bright = 11000
min_bright = 20000

# Exercise 2
```python 
# Dictionary of notes and their frequencies (in Hz)
NOTES = {
    'E5': float(659.25),
    'D#5': float(622.25),
    'B4': float(493.88),
    'D5': float(587.33),
    'C5': float(523.25),
    'A4': float(440.00)
}

# Melody: (note, duration) duration is in seconds
melody = [
    ('E5', 0.4),
    ('D#5', 0.4),
    ('E5', 0.4),
    ('D#5', 0.4),
