# Design Decisions for Exercise 1: Analog Input

## Photocell Setup:
Implemented a voltage divider with a 10k ohm resistor to connect the photocell to ADC2 (GP28). This converts light intensity into analog voltage readings that we can use to adjust LED brightness.

## Calibration Values:
After testing, set `max_bright = 20000` for bright conditions and `min_bright = 10000` for dim conditions. These values were chosen to calibrate the LEDâ€™s response to different light levels.

## LED Control:
Used `machine.Pin` to toggle the onboard LED brightness based on the light sensor input.  
Implemented a `clip()` function to ensure that the calculated duty cycle remains within the valid range `[0, 1]`.

## Loop Logic:
The code reads the analog value from the photocell, calculates the corresponding duty cycle, and uses it to adjust the on/off timing of the LED to simulate brightness changes.
